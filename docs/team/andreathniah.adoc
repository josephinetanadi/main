== PROJECT: NoteNote

---

== Overview

**NoteNote** is the go-to task management tool built for computing students to keep track of all your task right at your fingertips. With a minimalistic command line interface which users would be more than familiar with as computing students, NoteNote is an efficient tool that sorts through tasks quicky and efficiently. NoteNote also allows users to analyze their productivity, categorize their tasks, share tasks with their friends and many more.

== Summary of contributions
The introduction of group tags, a feature split into two seperate commands, are my main contributions to NoteNote. I also worked on enhancing the `listtag` feature and refactoring the original AddressBook into NoteNote.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to create group tags and apply them to tasks*
** What it does: allows users to create a group tag and add multiple child tags into it
** Justification: multiple tags can be repetitive to type out again and again especially if they are used often. This enhancement aims to reduce typing errors and allows a convenient way for users to easily create a group tag and apply them to different tasks.
** Highlights: This enhancement is split between `DefineTagCommand` which creates a group tag and `AddTagCommand` that applys existing group tag to a task. They should be used in conjunction.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a `listtag` command that allows the user to list down all tags and its associated task.
